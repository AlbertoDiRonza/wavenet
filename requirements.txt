python==3.10.0

# Required libraries for the wavenet project

# Deep Learning Framework (TensorFlow with integrated Keras)
# Replace with the exact TensorFlow version you used for development
tensorflow==2.10.0

# Numerical operations
# Specify a minimum version
numpy==2.1.3

# Scientific computing (signal processing, etc.)
# Specify a minimum version
scipy==1.15.3

# Note: Keras is integrated into TensorFlow from version 2.4.0 onwards.
# If you are using a TensorFlow version where Keras is integrated,
# you typically do not need to specify Keras separately unless you need
# a specific standalone Keras version (e.g., if your project was built
# with an older standalone Keras before the integration).
# If you do need a specific standalone Keras version:
# keras==2.10.0 # Replace with the exact Keras version
